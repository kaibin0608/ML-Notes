The uploaded file **`library_comparison.md`** is a **comprehensive evaluation document** comparing four major Python scheduling libraries ‚Äî **APScheduler**, **Rocketry**, **RQ-Scheduler**, and **Celery Beat** ‚Äî for a project named *Pulse*.

Here‚Äôs an explanation of the **criteria** and what each means, along with examples for context.

## üßÆ Scoring Logic

Each section (Technical, Architecture, etc.) is **weighted** based on project importance.
Example:

* Technical Requirements: 25%
* Architecture & Scalability: 20%
* Integration & Dependencies: 20%
* Developer Experience: 15%
* Monitoring & Operations: 10%
* Cost & Resources: 10%

Each library is rated 1‚Äì10 per section, multiplied by its weight, then summed for a **total score**.

**Example:**
Rocketry‚Äôs weighted score =
(9√ó0.25) + (6√ó0.2) + (9.5√ó0.2) + (9√ó0.15) + (6.5√ó0.1) + (9.5√ó0.1) = **8.15/10**

## üèÅ Summary of Each Library

| Library          | Strength                                                         | Weakness                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Rocketry**     | Best async support, modern syntax, simplest FastAPI integration. | No distributed workers yet.         |
| **APScheduler**  | Mature, job persistence built-in.                                | Limited scalability.                |
| **RQ-Scheduler** | Good dashboard, distributed.                                     | Needs Redis and wrappers for async. |
| **Celery Beat**  | Enterprise-grade, feature-rich.                                  | Complex setup, high resource use.   |

Would you like me to **summarize the final recommendation and decision criteria (section 8‚Äì10)** too ‚Äî i.e., *why Rocketry wins and when to use others*?
